## Assignments such as Gears, Gear Box, Motion Study, and Stress Analysis 

### Gear/Gearbox:
#### Objective
Create a gear with multiple configurations and then using that make a gearbox. 
#### The Gears
I started by creating all of the necessary equations, by the way, PI, is pie. Then I created the basic geometry using construction circles, it is crucial that you type in "=pitchDiameter" + 2 * "addendum" and not "pitchDiameter" + 2 * "addendum" because the latter will auto solve and become a fixed dimension. You know you've done it right when the sigma for equations is present. the rest of the construction is fairly straightforward. Then I created the 4 configurations, this is all pretty simple by following instructions and referencing the configurations assignments. I just cut holes and made the gears gold. 

#### The Box
The box is fairly straightforward. I started by making the subassemblies and then putting them all in a large assembly. Then I mated the together with good tooth spacing. After I did that I made the plate that holds it all together. This helped a lot because it ensures good spacing. Finally, for your gear mates make sure to make your ratio the two pitch diameters of the gears meshing, the auto-filled ratio will not work in my experience.
